## uvmcDoctrineTaskExtraPlugin adds new task in the doctrine namespace.

  * __`doctrine:delete-files-of-model`__

  This handy task will delete all the files related to a model. It will "take care" of Filters, Forms, Tables, Model   classes, even if the files are inside a plugin.

  Use it like this:

        php symfony doctrine:delete-files-of-model MyModel
